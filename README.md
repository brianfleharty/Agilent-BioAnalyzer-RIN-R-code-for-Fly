# Agilent-BioAnalyzer-RIN-R-code-for-Fly
Agilent BioAnalyzer RIN R code for Fly reads in exported data from a bioanalyzer total RNA chip run and returns a RNA integrity number.  The RNA integrity number is a score of 0-10 with 10 being the best and is based on the 28s/18s ribosomal peak ratios which should be equal to 2 for RNA of high integrity.
The code also produces a table of concentration and RIN values.
